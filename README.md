### Hey, I'm Aaron 👋🏻 

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building web applications. I specialize in C#/.NET Core and Angular, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

When I'm not coding, you can find me spending quality time with my family or playing five a-side football.
